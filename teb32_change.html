		<h1>GdiBatchCount displaced in WOW64 TEB by pointer to TEB64!</h1>

		<h4>Offset 0xF70 in 32-bit TEBs is widely considered to include a DWORD called GdiBatchCount.
		That is most likely true in native 32-bit releases of Windows NT, but not for WOW64 components
		of native 64-bit releases.</h4>

		<h4>I made this discovery when reversing RtlSetThreadErrorMode and its win32 subsystem base DLL (kernel32.dll)
		counterpart, SetThreadErrorMode. Here is the native x64 version of RtlSetThreadErrorMode from NT 6.0.6003:</h4>
		<img src="images/rtlsetthreaderrormode_x64.png"> 

		<h4>It is very simple; verify the first parameter to make sure that it only has any of the three valid enums[1] (and if not return
		STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_1), check for a null pointer in the second parameter (and if it's not null, feed it the second parameter
		featuring the old value of Teb->HardErrorMode), then update Teb->HardErrorMode and return TRUE, even though it is not a proper NTSTATUS value; this
		was corrected in Windows 7 (x64).</h4>

		<h4>I then disassembled the NT 6.0.6003 (Vista/Server 2008) WOW64 ntdll.dll and the NT 6.0.6002 IA32 ntdll.dll to see their implementations
		of the function.</h4>

		<h4>The IA32 variant returns STATUS_SUCCESS instead of TRUE, and shows that Teb32->HardErrorMode is at offset 0xF28.</h4>
		<img src="images/rtlsetthreaderrormode_ia32.png"> 

		<h4>The WOW64 variant is a bit surprising:</h4>
		<img src="images/rtlsetthreaderrormode.png"> 

		<h4>Instead of functioning similar to the IA32 variant, a pointer located at TEB32 offset 0xF70 is obtained, then the HardErrorMode variable
		is manipulated at its 64-bit offset from the dereferenced pointer; this means that a TEB64 struct pointer is present there.
		I don't intend to question the merit of having a TEB64 pointer in the WOW64 TEB32; the "true" TEB is TEB64 for all applications on 64-bit 
		Windows, and it is the only TEB the kernel will receive.</h4>

		<h2>Where is GdiBatchCount now?</h2>

		<h4>In the NT 6.0.6002 IA32 version of gdi32.dll, Teb32->GdiBatchCount is referenced in a few functions, such as SetBrushOrgEx(). The WOW64 version grabs GdiBatchCount from the TEB64 pointer in the TEB32.</h4>

		<h4>So, if you have a 32-bit application that looks up GdiBatchCount, remember this little quirk that it will encounter if running in WOW64 mode.</h4>

		<h4>With dozens of references to this TEB64 pointer in the WOW64 variant of gdi32, it is likely that the consolidation of GDI/win32 subsystem
		specific data into the 64-bit TEB struct for all win32 applications was the driving force for displacing GdiBatchCount.</h4>
		
		<h6>[1] The three valid enums for RtlSetThreadErrorMode are at: 
				0x10, which maps to SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS in SetThreadErrorMode;
				0x20, which maps to SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX in SetThreadErrorMode;
				0x40, which maps to SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX in SetThreadErrorMode</h6>
